# Wild Animal Sighting

Not that long ago I was able to see a beaver in its natural environment.
This made me thinking won't it be cool to have a website where you can have a database with all the animals you spotted in the wild.

## UX
 
#### User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to add my own animal on the site

- As a user I want to be able to have an option to delete what I submitted

- As a user I want to  be able to edit the data I submitted

- As a user I want to have a form to contact the developer of the website.

#### Design

The site is easy to use and got buttons with a clear use of style and design.
On mobile devices the layout is with big buttons and big enough pictures of their animal (if added) in the spotlist.
The navigation bar got a hamburger icon that brings up a sidenav with all the links to the pages.
On tablet this hamburger icon isn't there and are the links just in the navigation bar to the right.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
