# Wild Animal Sighting

Not that long ago I was able to see a beaver in its natural environment.
This made me thinking won't it be cool to have a website where you can have a database with all the animals you spotted in the wild.

## UX
 
#### User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to add my own animal on the site

- As a user I want to be able to have an option to delete what I submitted

- As a user I want to  be able to edit the data I submitted

- As a user I want to have a form to contact the developer of the website.

- As a user I want to be able to see all the animals I put in on the website.

#### Design

The site is easy to use and got buttons with a clear use of style and design.
On mobile devices the layout is with big buttons and big enough pictures of their animal (if added) in the spotlist.
The navigation bar got a hamburger icon that brings up a sidenav with all the links to the pages.
On tablet this hamburger icon isn't there and are the links just in the navigation bar to the right.
